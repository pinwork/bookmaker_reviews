      q: 'Which bookmaker is best for Ryder Cup betting?',
      a: 'Bet365 offers extensive in-play coverage. Sky Bet has strong British/European markets. Paddy Power provides novelty markets. Betfair Exchange offers liquidity for trading throughout the three days.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How important is home advantage in the Ryder Cup?',
      a: 'Extremely important — home teams have won 72% of Ryder Cups since 1985. The crowd atmosphere, course setup favoring the home team, and reduced travel fatigue all contribute to this significant advantage.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Should I bet on Europe or USA?',
      a: 'Consider home advantage first (72% win rate for hosts). Europe has the better recent record (11-8-1 since 1985) but USA has dominated at home. Team depth and chemistry are secondary factors.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How does match play betting differ from stroke play?',
      a: 'In match play, each hole is a separate competition. A player can lose a hole badly but still halve the match. Form is less predictive, and underdogs have better chances. Hole-by-hole swings create in-play opportunities.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What session is most important for betting?',
      a: 'Singles on Sunday determines 65% of Ryder Cups — with 12 points available, it\'s where comebacks happen or leads are protected. But teams trailing after Day 1 win just 18% of the time, so early sessions set the tone.',
