    {
      q: 'Which bookmaker is best for Masters snooker betting?',
      a: 'Bet365 offers excellent Masters coverage with frame-by-frame markets. Sky Bet has strong UK snooker pricing. Paddy Power provides enhanced odds for Ronnie O\'Sullivan. Betfair Exchange offers in-play trading opportunities.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How does the shorter format affect betting?',
      a: 'Best of 11 creates more variance than ranking events. One bad session means elimination — no recovery opportunity. Upsets are more common, but class still generally prevails. Consider this when assessing odds.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Should I back Ronnie O\'Sullivan at the Masters?',
      a: 'O\'Sullivan has won 8 Masters titles (45% since 2005). His record is extraordinary but odds reflect this dominance. Value may exist on other elite players, especially when O\'Sullivan\'s form is questionable.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How often do matches go to a decider?',
      a: '38% of Masters matches go to the final frame. With only 16 players, quality is high and matches are competitive. Consider correct score markets and decider specials for close matchups.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What\'s the best Masters betting strategy?',
      a: 'Focus on top 4 seeds reaching semi-finals (68% rate). The shorter format allows for match-by-match betting rather than outright. Recent form and Masters experience are key indicators. Decider markets offer value.',
