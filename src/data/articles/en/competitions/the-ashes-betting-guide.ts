    {
      q: 'Which bookmaker is best for Ashes betting?',
      a: 'Bet365 offers excellent in-play coverage. Sky Bet has strong UK cricket markets. Paddy Power provides enhanced odds on England. Betfair Exchange offers liquidity throughout each Test.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How important is home advantage in The Ashes?',
      a: 'Extremely important — home teams have won 72% of series since 1990. Australia in particular had an incredible run winning all away series in England from 1989-2019. Conditions, crowd support, and familiarity all contribute.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Should I bet on the series or individual Tests?',
      a: 'Both offer value. Series betting requires assessing squad depth and momentum. Individual Tests allow you to react to conditions and form. First Test result predicts series winner 68% of the time, so early betting is crucial.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How does weather affect Ashes betting?',
      a: 'Significantly, especially in England. Rain can force draws, affecting series markets. Check forecasts before betting. Draw probability increases in Manchester and Leeds historically. Day-night Tests in Australia have different weather considerations.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What makes a good Ashes betting candidate?',
      a: 'Look for batsmen averaging 45+ in the format, bowlers taking wickets at the venue, and players with strong head-to-head records. Form in the lead-up series matters. Captain experience in Ashes conditions is also a factor.',
