  body: `## Understanding PGA Championship Betting

### Why The PGA Is Different
The PGA Championship has unique characteristics:
- **Rotating venues** — different course each year
- **Strong fields** — typically deepest major
- **First-time winners** — historically produces breakthroughs
- **May timing** — players in mid-season form
- **Course setup** — PGA of America tends to favour scoring

### Key PGA Stats
- Favourite win rate: 20%
- First-time major winners: 44%
- Average winning score: -10 to -16
- Field strength: Highest among majors

## Best Betting Markets for PGA Championship

### Outright Winner
PGA betting considerations:
- **Current form** — May timing means active players
- **All-round game** — venue variety requires versatility
- **Major inexperience** — don't dismiss first-timers

### Each Way Value
With 156 players and open results:
- **5 places** paid by most bookmakers
- **Longer prices** can place frequently
- **First-time major threats** offer value

### First Major Winner Markets
The PGA's track record makes this valuable:
- **44% first-time winner** rate
- **Identify breakthrough candidates**
- **Enhanced odds** often available

## Venue Considerations

### Course Setup
PGA of America philosophy:
- **Scoreable conditions** — lower winning scores
- **Wide fairways** — less penal than USGA
- **Reachable par 5s** — birdie opportunities
- **Fair test** — rewards good play

### Recent Venues
Notable PGA Championship courses:
- **Valhalla** — Louisville, Kentucky
- **Oak Hill** — Rochester, New York

- **Kiawah Island** — Ocean Course

### Venue-Specific Betting
What to consider:
- **Course history** — previous results
- **Grass type** — bermuda vs bentgrass
- **Weather patterns** — May conditions
- **Length** — suits bombers or accuracy

## Betting Factors

### Statistical Indicators
Key stats for PGA success:
- **Strokes Gained: Total** — best overall indicator
- **Driving distance** — many venues favour length
- **Approach play** — iron shots to large greens

### Form Indicators
What form to consider:
- **Recent PGA Tour results** — mid-season form
- **Similar course types** — venue comparison
- **Major championship history** — big-game temperament

### Age Factor
PGA Championship trends:
- **Peak age 25-32** — 68% of recent winners
- **Young stars** — breakthrough venue
- **Veterans** — course management helps at some venues

## Live Betting Opportunities

### In-Play Markets
The PGA offers in-play value:
- **Moving day swings** — Saturday changes
- **Weather delays** — momentum shifts
- **Sunday drama** — late charges common`,

      q: 'Which bookmaker is best for PGA Championship betting?',
      a: 'Bet365 offers comprehensive markets and streaming. Paddy Power has good each way terms. DraftKings provides US-focused coverage. Betfair Exchange allows position trading throughout the four rounds.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Why does the PGA Championship produce so many first-time major winners?',
      a: 'The PGA of America typically sets up courses more fairly than USGA events, the May timing catches players in form, and the rotating venues mean less course-specific expertise is required.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How should I approach PGA Championship betting?',
      a: 'Focus on current form over course history (rotating venues), consider first-time major winner markets (44% hit rate), and look at Strokes Gained: Total as the best statistical predictor.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Is the favourite a good bet at the PGA Championship?',
      a: 'With a 20% strike rate, favourites win less often than in many tournaments. The deep fields and first-time winner trend means value often lies elsewhere. Consider each way on longer shots.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What stats matter most for PGA Championship betting?',
      a: 'Strokes Gained: Total is the best predictor. Driving distance matters at many venues. Approach play is crucial on typically larger greens. Recent form is more important than course history.',
