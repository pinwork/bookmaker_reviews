- When was this competition founded?
- How many teams/players participate?
- What is the format? (matches, rounds, duration)
- When does it take place? (season dates)
- Where is it held? (venue/country)

**Sources:** Official competition website, Wikipedia, established sports databases.

---

### 2. Betting Markets Overview

**A. Main Markets (Popular)**
List the most common, high-volume betting markets:
- Which markets do bookmakers prominently feature?
- Which markets are most popular among casual bettors?

**B. Micro-markets / Props (Low Competition)**
Find niche, player-level or event-specific markets:
- Player props (fouls, shots, aces, rushing yards, 180s)
- Situational markets (corners, cards, tiebreaks)
- Exotic markets (first scorer method, checkout color, exact score)

**C. Market Opportunity Analysis**
For each micro-market, assess:
- Is there existing content from competitors about this market? (Yes/No)
- Do bettors discuss this market on Reddit/forums? (High/Medium/Low interest)
- Is data available to analyze this market? (Yes/Partial/No)

**Format:**
```
| Market | Type | Competitor Content | Bettor Interest | Data Available | Opportunity |
|--------|------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Match Winner | Main | Saturated | High | Yes | Low |
| Player Fouls | Micro | Sparse | Medium | Yes | HIGH |
| Corners O/U | Micro | Some | Medium | Yes | Medium |
```

**What makes a HIGH opportunity micro-market:**
- Low competitor coverage (few guides explain it)
- Medium-High bettor interest (people search for it)
- Data available (can create Edge Patterns)

**Sources:** Major bookmakers (bet365, Betfair, DraftKings), betting forums, Reddit discussions.

### 3. Edge Patterns (CRITICAL)

**What is an Edge Pattern?**
An Edge Pattern is a specific, data-backed statistical trend that creates potential betting value. It's NOT generic knowledge ("home teams win more") — it's specific, actionable insight with numbers.

**Format for Edge Patterns:**
```
[WHO] + [SITUATION] + [OUTCOME] + [PERCENTAGE] + [SAMPLE SIZE]
```

**Examples:**
- "Liverpool covers -1.5 Asian Handicap in 72% of home matches vs bottom-6 teams (last 5 seasons, n=47)"
- "First-time Grand Slam finalists lose Wimbledon final 78% of time (Open Era, n=23)"
- "Teams coming off bye week cover NFL spread 58% (2015-2024, n=312)"
- "UK players at PDC World Championship Round 1 beat European opponents 67% (2018-2024, n=89)"

**What to look for:**
- Home/away splits by team quality tier
- Performance in specific situations (after loss, in playoffs, vs top/bottom opponents)
- Historical trends in specific markets (BTTS, Over/Under, handicaps)
- Player/team performance vs specific opponent types
- Weather/conditions impact (if applicable)
- Referee/official tendencies (cards, fouls, penalties)
- Tournament stage patterns (early rounds vs finals)
- Seasonal timing patterns (start of season, end of season, fixture congestion)

**Sources:** 
- Statistical databases (FBref, Transfermarkt, ESPN Stats, Opta)
- Academic sports analytics articles
- Betting community discussions (Reddit r/sportsbook, r/SoccerBetting, Covers forums)
- Sports analytics Twitter/X accounts
- Historical results databases

**Important:** Include sample size (n=X) and time period for every Edge Pattern. Without this, the data is not credible.
