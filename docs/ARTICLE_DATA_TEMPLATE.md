## Important Notes

1. **Be comprehensive, not brief** — Give me too much detail rather than too little. I will extract and condense.

2. **Don't summarize** — If a tool has 10 features, list all 10. If pricing has 3 tiers, describe all 3.

3. **Include URLs** — Every tool needs its official website URL. This is required.

4. **Brand colors help** — If you can find the brand's primary color (from their logo or website), include it. Otherwise describe it ("dark blue", "bright green").

5. **Be honest about cons** — A review with no cons looks fake. Every tool has weaknesses.

6. **Explain benefits, not features** — "Live xG tracking" means nothing to most readers. "See expected goals update in real-time so you can spot when a team is dominating despite the scoreline" explains why it matters.

7. **Target UK bettors** — Prices in GBP (£), mention UK availability, UK-relevant sports (football, horse racing, tennis).
